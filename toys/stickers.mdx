<Stickers />

The Sticker is a React component that applies various
sticker effects to it's children:

- normal
- comic
- puffy
- holographic outline
- holographic
- holographic monochrome

Holographic stickers accept **seed** prop that can be used
to generate unique holographic pattern for each sticker.

Inspired by iMessage stickers for iOS 17.
