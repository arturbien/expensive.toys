As you might already know, I have a thing for [Windows 95 UI](https://react95.io).
One of the most distinct thing about Windows 95 is its "3D" look.
All surfaces have edges and shadows, buttons actually look pressed when you click on them.
The 'unavailable' or 'disabled' button has a distinct look with its content appearing to be "carved" into the material.

But what happens if the button has an icon in it?
First let's take a look how these disabled icons looked like:

![Alt Text](/disabled-icons-1.png)
![Alt Text](/disabled-icons-2.png)
![Alt Text](/disabled-icons-3.png)
![Alt Text](/disabled-icons-4.png)

As you can see for monochrome icons (back/forward arrows in the example above) its quite easy.
You could just opt for SVG icons, and set their color and drop shadow via CSS and call it a day.

For multi colored icons it gets more complicated because
you would have to write more logic and style each shape and path
separately depending on the button state (enabled/disabled).
This would be really _painful_ to work with because at this point each icon
becomes a standalone component that involves dev time to make it work.

You could of course just create a variant of an icon with the disabled look, and swap them
when the buttons becomes disabled, right?
Well, not really. Not only it would require more work from the designer,
but it would not work for every color scheme of the UI. And you definately
don't want to create disabled variant of each icon for every possible color theme.

Here's where the **magic** of HTML SVG filters comes in!
Click the buttons below to toggle the effect on different themes and icons.

<DisabledIconsDemo.IconsDemo filterType="original" />

What is really cool about this filter is that it will work on anything you apply it to- SVGs,
images, HTML elements, videos... literally everything!

The filter used to achieve this effect looks like this:

```
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="0" height="0">
  <defs>
    <filter id="disabled-style">
      <feColorMatrix
        type="matrix"
        values="1 0 0 0 0
                0 1 0 0 0
                0 0 1 0 0
                -10 -10 -10 15 0"
        result="remove-bright-pixels"
      />
      <feFlood flood-color="var(--disabled-text-color)" result="color" />
      <feComposite in="color" in2="remove-bright-pixels" operator="in" />
      <feDropShadow
        dx="1"
        dy="1"
        flood-color="var(--disabled-highlight-color)"
        stdDeviation="0"
      />
    </filter>
  </defs>
</svg>
```

If you want to fiddle with this filter visit this [Codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/original-disabled-filter-wb0jfq?file=/index.html).

## How it works:

**feColorMatrix**: makes the bright pixels of the icon transparent.
The only channel we modify is the alpha channel (last row in the 'values' matrix),
where we basically say the more green, red and blue in a pixel (the brighter it is),
the more we deduct from the pixel opacity (-10 times ammount of a color in a pixel).
Fourth value in the alpha row (15) serves as a threshold for what we consider a bright
color - the smaller the value is, the more pixels will become transparent.

**feFlood**: fills the icon area with color

**feComposite**: takes result of **feFlood** and clips it with the shape of **feColorMatrix** result

**feDropShadow**: this does pretty much the same thing as CSS drop-shadow. Applying this shadow
gives us this "carved" look we are looking for.
