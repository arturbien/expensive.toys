During the last WWDC23 Apple event where Apple Vision Pro was revealed,
I've noticed this cool [Blur Vignette effect](https://youtu.be/TX9qSaGXFyg?t=128)
that was applied to the 3D content when it's watched in a headset.

And so I've decided to recreate it with pure CSS!

Below you'll find a brief explanation of how it works and
a CSS generator that will let you customize the effect to your needs.

## How it works

The effect is achieved by creating an overlay with [**backdrop-filter: blur()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter),
and a [**mask-image**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image)
that creates the vignette. The mask is a combination of 6 gradients -
4 radial gradients for each corner and 2 linear gradients.

See the image below to understand how these gradients are combined into a mask.
The black areas mark the parts of our overlay that will be visible.

Since it's just a more fancy overlay it will work for everything - you can place
it above videos, images or just regular HTML elements.

This vignette is also responsive and will adapt to the size of its container. ðŸ”¥

## Getting more creative

In this article I am only discussing the Blur Vignette, but
since we're operating with **backdrop-filter** you can get creative with
[different types of filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter),
not just blur, to achieve other interesting results.

Just switch up the filter and you can create a Grayscale Vignette, Sepia Vignette...whatever you like!

You can also stack multiple overlays with different
parameters on top of eachother to make the transition smoother.

Here are some examples of such usage:

## Blur Vignette Generator

To use the Blur Vignette effect in your own project, add the **.blur-vignette**
element inside any container, then paste the CSS code from generator below
inside your project.

Make sure to match the **--radius** parameter with the **border-radius** of
the container and that the container **position** is set to relative / absolute / fixed.
