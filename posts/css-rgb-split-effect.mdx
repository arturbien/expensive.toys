The RGB split effect, also known as RGB shift or 3D Anaglyph, is a popular
visual effect that adds a sense of depth and dimensionality to images
and videos. This effect is achieved by separating the red, green, and
blue color channels (or red and cyan) of an image or video and offsetting
them from each other. The result is a trippy, glitchy effect that makes
the image or video appear as if it is shifting or splitting apart.

While this effect is usually achieved by using a video editing software,
it is also possible to create it using CSS.

You might have already seen the effect recreated by
[stacking multiple elements on top of each other and applying **mix-blend-mode**](https://una.im/3d-effect/),
or in case of text by [using multiple **text-shadow**s](https://medium.com/@saratietz/css-anaglyph-text-effect-4afdb0803228).

However, there's simpler **custom CSS filter** approach that will let you
apply the effect to any element without the need to duplicate elements
or use multiple shadows.

In this blog post I'll explain how this effect works, how to use it
and I'll give you a tool for generating your own RGB split effects. Let's dive into it!

## How to use

Here's the filter that has to be embedded in HTML before we use it in CSS:

```
<svg width="0" height="0">
  <filter id="rgb-split">
    <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" dx="2" dy="2" result="layer-one" />
    <feComponentTransfer in="layer-one" result="red">
        <feFuncR type="identity" />
        <feFuncG type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
        <feFuncB type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
    </feComponentTransfer>

    <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" dx="-2" dy="-2" result="layer-two" />
    <feComponentTransfer in="layer-two" result="cyan">
        <feFuncR type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
        <feFuncG type="identity" />
        <feFuncB type="identity" />
    </feComponentTransfer>

    <feBlend in="red" in2="cyan" mode="screen" result="color-split" />
  </filter>
</svg>
```

Then in CSS all you have to do is:

```
#some-element {
  filter: url(#rgb-split);
  transform: translateZ(0);
}
```

The **transform: translateZ(0);** improves the rendering in Safari
and removes some of the artifacts that filter sometimes creates.

## How it works

- The **feOffset** primitives are used to create two duplicate layers of the image:
  one shifted to the right and downwards (**dx="2" dy="2"**) and the other one shifted
  to the left and upwards (**dx="-2" dy="-2"**).
- The **feComponentTransfer** primitives are used to modify the color channels
  of each layer.

  In the first one, only the red channel is kept while the green and blue channels
  are turned off (resulting in <span style={{color: "red"}}>**red**</span> layer).

  ```
  <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" dx="2" dy="2" result="layer-one" />
  <feComponentTransfer in="layer-one" result="red">
      <feFuncR type="identity" />
      <feFuncG type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
      <feFuncB type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
  </feComponentTransfer>
  ```

  For the second layer its the opposite - green and blue channels are kept
  and the red channel is turned off (resulting in <span style={{color: "cyan"}}>**cyan**</span> layer).

  ```
  <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" dx="-2" dy="-2" result="layer-two" />
  <feComponentTransfer in="layer-two" result="cyan">
      <feFuncR type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
      <feFuncG type="identity" />
      <feFuncB type="identity" />
  </feComponentTransfer>
  ```

- Finally **feBlend** is used to blend the two modified layers of the
  image (red and cyan) together using the "screen" mode. This mode brightens
  the image, and helps to create the RGB split effect.

## The "RGB split" CSS filter generator

To make things easier for you, I've created this simple RGB split effect
generator that will let customize it to your needs.

There's also an option to copy the inlined CSS filter so you can use it directly
in CSS without having to embed the SVG in HTML.

<Warning>
  Unfortunately inlined CSS SVG filters are **not** supported by **Safari
  (16.4)** so you need to embed SVG in HTML to support all browsers.
