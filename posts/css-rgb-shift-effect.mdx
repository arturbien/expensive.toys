The RGB shift effect, also known as RGB split effect, is a popular
visual effect that adds a sense of depth and dimensionality to images
and videos. This effect is achieved by separating the red, green, and
blue color channels (or red and cyan) of an image or video and offsetting
them from each other. The result is a trippy, glitchy effect that makes
the image or video appear as if it is shifting or splitting apart.

While this effect is usually achieved by using a video editing software,
it is also possible to create it using CSS.

You might have already seen the effect recreated with the use of **mix-blend-mode** and
stacking multiple elements on top of each other, or in case of
text, using multiple **text-shadow**. However, this approach is a hacky and
limited way of going about it.

In this article, I will show you how to create the RGB shift effect
that will work on any kind of element with just one line of CSS.

## How it works

- The feOffset element is used to create two duplicate versions of the image:
  one shifted to the left and downwards (dx="-10" dy="5") and one shifted
  to the right and upwards (dx="10" dy="-5").
- The feComponentTransfer element is used to modify the color channels
  of each version of the image. In the first one, only the red channel
  is kept (<feFuncR type='identity' />) while the green and blue channels
  are set to zero (<feFuncG type='discrete' tableValues='0' />
  <feFuncB type="discrete" tableValues="0" />
  ). In the second version, only the green and blue channels are kept (<feFuncR
    type="discrete"
    tableValues="0"
  />
  <feFuncG type="identity" /> <feFuncB type="identity" />) while the red channel
  is set to zero.
- The feBlend element is used to blend the two modified versions of the
  image together using the "screen" mode (mode='screen'). This mode brightens
  the image, and helps to create the RGB shift effect.
- The feMerge element is used to merge the modified image with the original
  image. This is done to keep the original detail of the image while applying
  the RGB shift effect.

By applying these steps, the filter produces an RGB shift effect on the image, where the red and cyan color channels are separated and shifted slightly from each other. This effect creates a dynamic, glitchy look that can add an interesting visual element to your CSS and HTML designs.
