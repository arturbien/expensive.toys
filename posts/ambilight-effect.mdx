Have you ever heard of the "Ambilight Effect"? It's a feature in some TVs
that illuminates the wall behind the screen with colors that match the content
being displayed. This effect enhances the viewing experience by "extending"
the image beyond the TV onto a wall behind it creating more immersive experience.

But did you know that you can create this effect on your website using CSS?
That's right, by using SVG filters, we can achieve the same result and add
some visual flair to our web pages. In this blog post, we'll explore how to
create the Ambilight Effect with CSS and SVG filters.

So, let's dive in and start creating some stunning visual effects for our web pages!

## How it works

If you're new to SVG filters I highly recommend reading this awesome
[SVG Filters 101](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/01/15/svg-filters-101/)
article first.

So here's the magical filter. It may look daunting but if you read it carefully
and play with the Ambilight Effect Generator below you should get a feeling of
how it actually works.

```
<svg width="0" height="0">
    <filter
        id="ambilight"
        width="300%"
        height="300%"
        x="-0.75"
        y="-0.75"
        color-interpolation-filters="sRGB"
    >
        <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" result="source-copy" />
        <feColorMatrix
            in="source-copy"
            type="saturate"
            values="3"
            result="saturated-copy"
        />
        <feColorMatrix
            in="saturated-copy"
            type="matrix"
            values="1 0 0 0 0
                    0 1 0 0 0
                    0 0 1 0 0
                    33 33 33 101 -133"
            result="bright-colors"
        />
        <feMorphology
            in="bright-colors"
            operator="dilate"
            radius="10"
            result="spread"
        />
        <feGaussianBlur
            in="spread"
            stdDeviation="30"
            result="ambilight-light"
        />
        <feOffset in="SourceGraphic" result="source" />
        <feComposite in="source" in2="ambilight-light" operator="over" />
    </filter>
</svg>
```

- Increase the **filter** Filter Region to 300% by using the
  **width** and **height** attributes, then centering the region with the **x** and **y** attributes.
  This makes sure that the "Ambilight" light source is not clipped by the
  object bounding box.
- First **feOffset** makes a copy of the **SourceGraphic**.
  It will be used as a base for our "Ambilight" light.
- Then, **feColorMatrix** takes that copy and saturates it by 3x.
- Then another **feColorMatrix** removes dark pixels from the previous step.
  The **-132** is our color cutoff parameter that removes pixels that
  are below **32%** brightness.
- **feMorphology** spreads the bright colors from the previous step outwards.
  This is our "spread" parameter that controls how far the "Ambilight" light
  source will spread.
- Then using **feGaussianBlur** we blur the previous step. This is our "blur" parameter
  that produces the final "Ambilight" light source effect.
- Finally, using **feOffset** we copy the original image again and use **feComposite** to
  combine it with the ambilight light source from the previous step.
